# Hand Sign Detection using TFLite and OpenCV

A real-time hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow Lite, OpenCV, and cvzone's HandTrackingModule. The project includes data collection, model inference, and classification for various hand signs.

## üîß Features
- Hand detection and bounding box extraction using cvzone
- Classification using a custom TensorFlow Lite model
- Real-time video stream from webcam
- Easy-to-extend for more gestures

## üß† Model
The model used here is a TensorFlow Lite model optimized for real-time classification on devices. It takes 224x224 hand-cropped images as input and predicts the gesture class.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset
To use this project, you must have a dataset of hand gestures. You can:
1. Run `DataCollection.py` to collect your own hand gesture images.
2. Organize them into folders named by class (e.g., `Hello`, `Okay`, `Thanks`, etc.) under the `/Data` directory.

> **Note**: The actual dataset is not included in this repository. Please use the script to create your own dataset.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
### 1. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Collect Data (Optional)
```bash
python DataCollection.py
```
Use this script to collect images for each hand gesture class.

### 3. Run the Detection Script
```bash
python test.py
```

- Press `q` to quit the real-time prediction window.

## ‚úÖ Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- cvzone
- Numpy
